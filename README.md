# ASUS Arch Linux Home Configs

This repository contains home directory dotfile configuration files.  The
repository is in the directory `~/.home-git`.  Config files are symlinked from
the home directory into this directory (they are stored here).

The shell script `symlink.sh` should create all the symlinks.
